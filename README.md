**LuaCrypt Test Suite**

This is the public release of LuaCrypt's internal test suite.

LuaCrypt was validated against over 1,200 unique scripts. What you'll find here are the ones that *actually mattered*, the stress tests that exposed weaknesses and the scenarios that made LuaCrypt better.

**Why release this?**

Trust is earned through proof, not promises.

LuaCrypt doesn't have years of production history to point to yet. What it does have is a rigorous commitment to quality, security, and transparency. This repository is how we back that up: by showing exactly what we tested, what we found, and what we fixed.
